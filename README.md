LCDB Website
===============

## Purpose
This website will be used by the biologists in LCDB in order to speed up their
scientific research. The end goal is to create three different interconnected
graphs that researchers can use to analyze their NGS data.  This will be done
by first using an MA plot of identify up and down regulated genes.  These genes
can then be selected to be placed into a colocalization heatmap containing ChIP-Seq
data.  Any of the colocalized proteins can then be selected and compared using a
binary heatmap.  In this way a lot of the regulatory information can be obtained
by the biologist without having to rely on a bioinformatician.  Please view image
